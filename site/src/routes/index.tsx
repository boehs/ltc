      <p>I'm not Seth.</p>
      <p>Since 2008, <abbr title="Letters to crushes">LTC</abbr> has been chugging along, miraculously untouched by constantly morping yet ever angry internet tides.</p>
      <p>I view this community as a true bastion of optimism, of hope, of dream. Yet, I was scared. I caught glimpses of peeling paint, and I feared that maybe soon this community's time would come to an end.</p>
      <p>So I hatched a plan. I began saving posts and comments on this site - just in case. I'm pleased to announce with certainty that ~99.9% of letters & comments have been archived on a private server.</p>
      <p><b>On x, this domain expired.</b> This means that letterstocrushes.com could be bought by anyone, and no matter what would have gone in it's place, that's 13 years of lost dreams, so I stepped in.</p>
      <p>Now that the old LTC is gone, I'm building a modern site. One that is ready to last another 10 years. It will look the same, but with new features and a modern, more secure backend.</p>
      <p>The following will be preserved on v2:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>All letters</li>
        <li>All comments</li>
        <li>All feedback</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The following will be lost:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>User accounts</li>
        <li>Chat history</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You might be angry, so I would like to reiterate: If nothing had been done, this community would be lost to history forever.</p>
      <p>Soon, LTC will be back better than before and I will do everything to protect it.</p>
      <p>If you were a moderator please email me, I have ways to verify and reinstate you.</p>
      <p>With love, Evan</p>
