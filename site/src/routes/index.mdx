Since 2008, LTC has been chugging along, miraculously untouched by constantly morping yet ever angry internet tides.

I view this community as a true bastion of optimism, of hope, of dream. Yet, I was scared. I saw little warnings that maybe soon our time would come to an end. Turns out I was right. On x, LTC went down for good.

But before that happened, I began saving the posts and comments here - just in case. With certainty, over 99.99% made it. This put me in a perfect position to step in, and so I did.

Now that the old LTC is gone, I'm building a modern site. It will look the same, but with new features and a new, more secure backend.

The following will be preserved on v2:

* All letters
* All comments

The following will be lost:

* User accounts
* Chat

You might be angry, so I would like to reiterate: If nothing had been done, this community would be lost to history forever.

Right now, as I work, LTC is read-only. **If you want to:**

- Read **new** letters: Press "n" or **click on "new"** at the top
- Read **random** letters: Press "r" or **click on "random"** at the top
- **Search** letters: Press "s" or **click on "search"** at the top

If you were a moderator please email me, I have ways to verify you.

With love, Evan
