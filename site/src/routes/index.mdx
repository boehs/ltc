I'm not Seth.

Since 2008, LTC has been chugging along, miraculously untouched by constantly morping yet ever angry internet tides.

I view this community as a true bastion of optimism, of hope, of dream. Yet, I was scared. I caught glimpses of peeling paint, and I feared that maybe soon this community's time would come to an end.

So I hatched a plan. I began saving posts and comments on this site - just in case. I'm pleased to announce with certainty that ~99.9% of letters & comments have been archived on a private server.

**On x, this domain expired.** This means that letterstocrushes.com could be bought by anyone, and no matter what would have gone in it's place, that's 13 years of lost dreams, so I stepped in.

Now that the old LTC is gone, I'm building a modern site. One that is ready to last another 10 years. It will look the same, but with new features and a new, more secure backend.

The following will be preserved on v2:

* All letters
* All comments

The following will be lost:

* User accounts
* Chat

You might be angry, so I would like to reiterate: If nothing had been done, this community would be lost to history forever.

Soon, LTC will be back better than before and I will do everything to protect it. **If you want to:**

- Read **new** letters: Press "n" or **click on "new"** at the top
- Read **random** letters: Press "r" or **click on "random"** at the top
- **Search** letters: Press "s" or **click on "search"** at the top

If you were a moderator please email me, I have ways to verify you.

With love, Evan
